### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile as it is aimed for use at any point in the day, where someone may not have quick access to a desktop or laptop. The camera will also be used to allow the user to upload photos of the location they visit.
- **Story:** This app will allow people to streamline their coffee purchase experience by seeing review information provided by others, and contribute reviews based on the experiences they have.
- **Market:** Any individual who drinks coffee could use this app, which is most people in the USA.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as one wants to find a place to get coffee, and many people drink coffee multiple times throughout the day.
- **Scope:** We plan to start with the bare review functionality. After this, the app can evolve to include more social features, such as chatting in a forum about different locations or setting up events with other local users.
